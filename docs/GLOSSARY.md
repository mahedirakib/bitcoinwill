# Bitcoin Glossary

Essential Bitcoin terminology for understanding TIP and Bitcoin Will.

## Address Types

### P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash)
A SegWit address type that locks funds to a script hash. Bitcoin Will uses P2WSH for vault addresses because it's more efficient than legacy P2SH.

**Example:** `tb1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh`

### SegWit (Segregated Witness)
A Bitcoin protocol upgrade that separates signature data from transaction data, reducing fees and enabling new features like P2WSH.

## Keys

### Public Key
A cryptographic key that can be shared publicly. Used to receive Bitcoin and verify signatures. In Bitcoin Will, you provide public keys (not private keys).

**Format:** 66 hexadecimal characters starting with 02 or 03

### Private Key
A secret cryptographic key that allows spending Bitcoin. NEVER share your private key. Bitcoin Will never asks for private keys.

### Compressed Public Key
A 33-byte (66 hex char) public key format. Modern standard for Bitcoin. Must start with 02 or 03.

## Scripts

### Bitcoin Script
A stack-based scripting language used to define spending conditions. Bitcoin Will creates scripts with two paths: owner immediate spend, and beneficiary timelocked spend.

### Witness Script
The actual script that defines spending conditions for a P2WSH address. Required to spend from the vault.

**Example:**
```
OP_IF
    <owner_pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ELSE
    <locktime_blocks> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP
    <beneficiary_pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF
```

### OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)
A Bitcoin opcode that enforces a relative timelock. The output can only be spent after a specified number of blocks have passed since it was confirmed.

**Key property:** Timer resets each time funds move.

## Timelocks

### Relative Timelock
A delay measured from when a transaction confirms. CSV uses relative timelocks. If you set 144 blocks, the beneficiary must wait ~1 day from when funds last moved.

### Absolute Timelock
A delay measured to a specific block height or time. Not used in Bitcoin Will (we use relative timelocks).

### Block
A group of Bitcoin transactions confirmed together. Approximately every 10 minutes on average.

## Wallets

### Descriptor
A text string that describes how to derive addresses and scripts from keys. Bitcoin Will generates descriptors for wallet import.

**Example:** `wsh(bitcoincore_script(6376a914...88ac))`

### Recovery Kit
A JSON file generated by Bitcoin Will containing all technical details needed to recover funds. Includes address, scripts, descriptors, and keys.

### HD Wallet (Hierarchical Deterministic)
A wallet that generates many keys from a single seed phrase. Public keys exported from HD wallets work with Bitcoin Will.

## Network Terms

### Testnet
A Bitcoin test network with worthless "test" coins. Used for testing and development. Bitcoin Will defaults to Testnet.

### Mainnet
The production Bitcoin network with real BTC. Use with caution.

### Regtest
A local-only Bitcoin network for development. Not connected to the internet.

## Transactions

### UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
A chunk of Bitcoin that hasn't been spent. Your vault holds UTXOs until someone spends them.

### Funding Transaction
The transaction that sends Bitcoin to your vault address. The timelock timer starts from when this confirms.

### Spending Transaction
A transaction that moves Bitcoin out of the vault. Requires satisfying the script conditions.

## Protocol Terms

### TIP (TimeLock Inheritance Protocol)
A Bitcoin-native inheritance protocol pattern that uses CSV timelocks without custodians. Bitcoin Will is a reference implementation of TIP.

### Dead Man's Switch
A mechanism that triggers if someone becomes inactive. In Bitcoin Will, if the owner doesn't move funds, the beneficiary can claim them after the delay.

### Non-Custodial
A system where you maintain full control of your keys. No third party holds or can access your Bitcoin.

## Security Terms

### Air-Gapped
A computer or device not connected to any network. Bitcoin Will can run on air-gapped machines for maximum security.

### Cold Storage
Keeping keys offline (on hardware wallets or paper) for security.

### Counterparty Risk
The risk that someone you trust might act against your interests. Bitcoin Will eliminates counterparty risk by being non-custodial.
